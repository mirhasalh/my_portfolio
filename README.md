# my_portfolio

A Flutter project for Irhas's portfolio.

## About My Portfolio

This project is used to showcase Irhas's Flutter projects. I'm happy üòÅ to prove that navigator 2.0 for web is less intimidating with help of go_router.

## Supported platforms

- Android ([.apk](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/cqoghbdsa3iisbusoxkkm/h?rlkey=wz8cyejx1auq8zo3f0tpl0mgu&dl=0))
- [Web](https://flutter.mirhasalh.xyz/#/)

## Installation

```bash
# Get dependencies
$ flutter pub get

# Run the Flutter app
$ flutter run
```

## Run scripts

```bash
$ flutter_scripts run
```

Read the documentation about [flutter_scripts](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scripts) for activation guide.

## VS Code

This project utilizes code generator, excluding the generated files by adding settings to `.vscode/settings.json` to prevent manual modifications.

```json
{
  "files.exclude": {
    "**/*.freezed.dart": true,
    "**/*.g.dart": true
  }
}
```
